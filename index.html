        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Catherine Sosa Lazaro and I am a first year Theater, Film and Digital Production major at University of California Riverside. My concentration is in film making and I am especially interested in screenwriting specifically. However, my concentration is in film making to be well-rounded in all aspects of the film industry. Many in this department are encouraged to be well rounded in different aspects of theater and film in which one acquires skill sets in writing, filming and acting. 
<br><br>

        I am a first generation Latina college student so my career choice was bound to have some struggles in terms of my family accepting my choices. Their opinions of my major were not always positive which later affected my initial perspective in my major. I was in a position where I didn’t know whether to stay in the TFDP department or change my major into something more ‘stable’. However, during this time I was taking the course Intro to TFDP in which various people in the field and professors from UCR came to give advice and tell their story. I learned a lot of things from people directly in the field. Many were well rounded in their skills and had more than one job to create a healthy balance which allowed them to continue pursuing what they truly wanted to do. They shared their hardships and success in which all encouraged us TFDP students to continue through obstacles we face. Many expressed that everyone has their own pace to get to where they want to be. Especially since it takes a lot of experience to be very successful in this industry which is why they encouraged staying at your own pace. Despite the struggle of self-doubt within myself and my surroundings  in pursuing a career that may seem difficult to achieve I decided to  continue to work hard to prove something that may seem impossible. Courses I will take to continue learning are screenwriting and film production courses. As well as joining a Latinx club that is specialized in Latinx productions in which they create the works and publish them on campus. 
<br><br>
       
        Despite my heavy interest in the film industry I was not in any previous organizations or clubs that were focused around film and theater. I was in the arts however, not in anything film related. My interest in film came from the outlet it gave to people for their creativity. I always thought I was creative, however, I had trouble bringing my ideas into life. Being in the TFDP department I can work with others to bring my ideas into life. This department gave me a sense of belonging in terms of everyone wanting a similar end goal in their career. This is why I chose to continue to be a Theater, Film, and Digital Production Major.
